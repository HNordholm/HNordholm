# Hello

Final-year Economics student at Linnaeus University graduating 4th June. Here, you find projects in digital performance analysis, ecommerce behavior, statistical analysis and reporting.  
I work with tools such as **Google Analytics 4**, **R**, **SQL**, **Looker studio**, and **R Markdown** to deliver clear and actionable insights through visuals and statistical evidence.
