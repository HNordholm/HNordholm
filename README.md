## Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio!
 
Since the first time I was introduced to R Iâ€™ve been hooked. Programming for me is not just about writing code, itâ€™s become a lifestyle. In this portfolio youâ€™ll find my projects related to ML, visualizations, and more! I hope you enjoy exploring them.

Best regards,
Hampus
