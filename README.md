# Hello

I'm a final-year Economics student at Linnaeus University. Here, you find projects in digital performance analysis, ecommerce behavior, statistical analysis and reporting.  
I work with tools like **Google Analytics 4**, **R**, **SQL**, and **RMarkdown** to produce actionable insights, and I share weekly analysis and projects here on GitHub.

## Current project

### [GA4 Weekly reporting portfolio](https://github.com/HNordholm/weekly-GA4-reporting-)

A recurring analytics project based on the **Google Analytics 4 demo store**, where I answer questions through weekly reports covering:

- Funnel performance analysis  
- Product-level insights  
- Audience segmentation 
- Traffic source evaluation and engagement metrics

All reports are created in Rmarkdown and exported as PDFs with annotated GA4 visuals.
